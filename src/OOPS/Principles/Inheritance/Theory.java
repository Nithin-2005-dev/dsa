    types of inheritance:-
    1)single inheritance:one clas extends another class
    2)multi-level inheritance:occurrence of multiple single inheritance
    3)multiple inheritance:one class extending more than one classes
    ->java doesn't support it.
    ->it can be implemented by interfaces
    4)hierarchical inheritance:one class is inherited by many classes
    5)hybrid inheritance:it is a combination of single and multiple inheritance
    ->it can't be done with java
